## A first look at React

- Components: building blocks of React
- Declarative: JSX (telling react what a component should look like based on current state). React is an abstraction from DOM
- State Driven: React reacts to state changes by re-rendering the UI
- JS Library: in MVC its just View. You need Next.js and Remix

## Pure React

- Go to https://react.dev/learn/installation#try-react-locally and download the html and try

## Setting up a React Project

- create-react-app and vite (use this for real apps)

## Setting our first Project

- cd folder-name -> npx create-react-app app-name
