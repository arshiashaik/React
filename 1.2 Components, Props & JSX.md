## Rendering the Root component and activating strict mode

- StrcitMode renders the components twice to find and remove any bugs. And also react uses this to check for any outdated parts of React API
  
```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function App() {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>
}

// React V18
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root');
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode> 
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
)

// React before v18
// React.render(<App />, document.getElemnetById('root');
```
## Components:

- They have their own Data, Logic and Appearance(JSX)

```
function App() {
  <Pizza /> // using component
}

// Component 
function Pizza() {
  return <h1>Pizza</h1>
}

```

## JSX:

- Declarative syntax to describe what components look like and how they work.
- Components must return a block of JSX.
- Extension of JS that allows us to embed JS, CSS, and React componets into HTML.
- Babel is responsible for converting JSX elements to React.createElemnt function call.
- JSX is basically declarative i.e., we tell react how we want the UI to look like using JSX, based on current data. We never touch the DOM. React automatically handles the UI by itself using our JSX. On the other hand vanilla JS is imperative i.e., step-by-step DOM manipulations until we reach a desired UI.
- To enter JS mode (to write logic) inside the JSX elements use {}. Anything isnide the curly brackets is going to be your JS logic.
```
function Footer() {
  return <footer>{new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}. We're currently     open</footer>
}
```
or 
since coponents are nothing but JS functions write JS directly inisde them.
```
function Footer() {
const hour = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
  return <footer>{hour}. We're currently open</footer>
}
```

## Separation of Concerns 

- Traditional approach: One technology per file.
- React's Approach: One UI component per file. Which has its own data, logic and appearance.

## Styling in React:

- React does not have any soecific rules or opinion sabout styling.
- One can use 1. Tailwind CSS 2. External css/sass file or inline styling.
- For inline styling you cannopt directly use style = 'color: red' like you did in html. Instead you need to use JS object. So enter JS mode using {} and then create an object with styles.
```
<footer style={{color: 'red'}}><footer>
```
or
```
const style = {color: 'red', fontSize: '48px'}
<footer style={style}><footer/>
```
- NOTE: make sure to use camel case only in react. e.g., font-size becomes fontSize

## Props:

- Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components (down the component tree).
- Essential tool to configure and customize components (like function parameters)
- With props, parent componenets control how child components look and work
- Anything can be passed as props: single values, arrays, objects, functions, even other components

```
function App() {
  <Pizza
    name='Funny'
    ingredients ='Tomato, Mushrooms'
    photoName='pizzas/spinaci.jpg'
    price={10}
  /> // Top pass numbers using props enter JS mode
}

// Component 
function Pizza(props) {
  return <div><h1>{props.name}</h1><p>{props.ingredients}</p></div>
}
